Source lives on server.  To work on the server code locally, do:
mkdir -p /home/brian/Documents/local-binary-sshmount
sshfs bman7777@ssh.pythonanywhere.com:/home/bman7777/local-binary /home/brian/Documents/local-binary-sshmount

Then make git work, by:
cd /home/brian/Documents/local-binary-sshmount
git status
(if not on master) git checkout master
git checkout -b blm/lb/branch-name

git commit -a
git push origin blm/lb/branch-name

For some reason atom still doesn't know how to view diffed changes.
